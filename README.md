# copytoggle.vim

Vim's pastetoggle for copying

## Overview

You know the issue if you have listchars or showbreak configured, or use
line numbers. Copying code from vim into another application results in a
mess because all those formatting characters are included. copytoggle.vim
allows you to set a mapping to toggle those features off while copy-pasting:

    nmap <F3> <Plug>copytoggle

## Requirements

* Vim 7.0+

## Installation

It is recommended to install this plugin using a plugin manager like
[pathogen.vim](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
[Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) or
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Alternatively you can just drop the `plugin` and `doc` folders into your
`~/.vim` directory. Don't forget to run `:helptags ~/.vim/doc` to generate the
help tags after a manual installation.
